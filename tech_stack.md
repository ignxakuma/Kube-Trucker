# Technology Stack

This document outlines the technology stack for the kube-trucker application.

## Frontend

*   **Framework**: React
*   **Reasoning**: React is a popular and powerful library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture will help us create a modular and maintainable frontend.

## Backend (Location & Route History Services)

*   **Runtime**: Node.js
*   **Framework**: Express
*   **Reasoning**: Node.js is a lightweight and efficient runtime that is well-suited for microservices. Express provides a simple yet powerful way to build our APIs.

## Database

*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **Reasoning**: PostgreSQL is a robust and reliable open-source relational database. It has excellent support for complex queries and can be extended with PostGIS for advanced geospatial features if we decide to add them later.

## Containerization

*   **Tool**: Docker
*   **Reasoning**: Docker is the industry standard for containerization. It will allow us to package our services and their dependencies into isolated containers, which is a prerequisite for running them in Kubernetes.

## Orchestration

*   **Platform**: Kubernetes
*   **Reasoning**: Kubernetes is the leading container orchestration platform. It will allow us to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of our containerized application.
